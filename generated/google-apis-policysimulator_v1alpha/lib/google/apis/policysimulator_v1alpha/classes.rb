      # an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
      # Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a
      # logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
      # evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
      # the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
